## Introduction

`ethvtx` is an Ethereum-Ready & Framework-Agnostic Redux configuration. This package contains all the tools to build an efficient Redux store for your Dapp. Our goal was to create a tool that will allow Dapp developers to efficiently fetch and manipulate informations about the Ethereum Blockchain. By minimizing the amount of requests and by caching and reusing as much data as possible, we decrease the impact our apps have on the Ethereum nodes.

## Installation

`ethvtx` is an npm package with few dependencies. You will need to install it along `redux` and `redux-saga`

``` bash
npm install --save ethvtx redux redux-saga
```

You are good to go, next step will be store creation !
